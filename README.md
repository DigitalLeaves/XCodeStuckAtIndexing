# XCode 8 Stuck At Indexing

This repository contains a sample project that will make XCode 8 get stuck at "indexing" and never be able to compile the project. It's a really simple project, just some buttons in a UIViewController and a method that initializes an array of the buttons and try to do some operations on them.

Also, a method called thisOperationIsOhSoComplex() demonstrates the problems that swift 3 compiler and XCode 8 have with some operations, tagged as "too complex" when trying to build the project.
